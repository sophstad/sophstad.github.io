title: Pushing

I’ve never pushed before.* So far, all of my web projects have been theoretical sites created so that I could teach myself a little bit about how the web works. I've decided to create a personal page so that I have something to refine and practice with. It will (hopefully) be constantly evolving.

Here are some things I’d like to add:

* Responsiveness
* Improved blog
* [Adaptive Images](http://adaptive-images.com)

Wish me luck!

*Now that I think about it, that’s a lie. I made my own Tumblr theme.
