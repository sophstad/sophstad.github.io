There are a lot of systems that I use day to day. Some keep me organized, some influence my habits, and some are just for fun. This is a running archive of those.

### Currently

1. [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/sophstad) keeps track of what I want to read. I only started using it a few weeks ago after a few failed attempts with [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), but I'm really appreciating it.
2. [Last.fm](www.last.fm/user/sw1m97) has long tracked my music-listening data. Despite its apparent neglect and a few holes in my scrobbling data, I love it.
3. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/sophstad) is the primary way that I listen to music.

### Previously
1. I've used [Reporter](wwww.reporter-app.com) with much success in the past, but lately entering information has felt tedious. I hope to pick it up again soon.
