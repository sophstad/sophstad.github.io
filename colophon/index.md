This site has two goals: to tell you a little bit about myself, and to be as fast as possible.

One of these is pretty easy to do; the other is a bit trickier. Here’s how I’ve optimized for speed so far:

1. __System fonts__: San Francisco is a really nice font. As GitHub, Facebook, and others have done, I’ve adopted it for my own use. This saves you from having to download anything.
2. __Hosting__: GitHub Pages are pretty fast. Maybe other hosts are faster, but this is good enough for now.
3. __Smart CSS__: I can’t recommend [Basscss](http://basscss.com) highly enough. It’s intuitive to use, [scalable](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/), and looks great. Also, it’s quick and sustainable because of [functional CSS](http://www.jon.gold/2015/07/functional-css/).

I like documentation a lot, so I keep [a log](https://github.com/sophstad/sophstad.github.io/releases) of this site’s releases on GitHub.
