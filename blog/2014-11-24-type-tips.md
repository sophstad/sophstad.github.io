title: Type Tips

A few principles I like to follow when I’m writing:

- Sans serif for getting ideas down
- Monospaced for drafts and anything remotely technical
- Caslon for when I want to sound like I’m writing for *The New Yorker*

The link between typeface and voice is known to be profound for readers, but I’m increasingly noticing its effects on me as a writer. Using the right typeface can make an essay flow—it’s too bad all of my schoolwork has to be submitted in Times New Roman.
